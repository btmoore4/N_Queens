# N Queens Solution Visualizer

## [Visit the Visualizer](http://btmoore4.github.io/N_Queens/)

A simple web app application showing the common problem known as the "N Queen Problem".
This problem is often used as a example of a dynammic programming solution, and this site was developed while studying for my CS 374 midterm which included dynammic programming. 
Here is an example of the problem and the algorithm visualized based on a [Cornell University paper](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdz/Papers/RZ-IPL92.pdf). Enjoy!
